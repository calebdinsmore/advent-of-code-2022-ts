# Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022, written in TypeScript!

Note: `day0` is the template used to generate each day's boilerplate: actual implementations start at `day1`.

## How to use

Initial setup

 - `npm install`

For each day, where `X` is the day number (1-25):

 - run `npm run setup X` from your terminal
 - Visit [https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/X/input](#fill_in_your_day) and copy the contents in your `inputs/dayX/part1.txt` file
 - Implement the necessary logic in `solveForPart1` 
 - Do the same for part 2
 - `npm run start X` to run the day's test
 - `npm test` to run your tests
 - Profit! ðŸŽ‰
